# Introduction
My goal in this project is to create a visualisation of music that is inputted into the program.
The aim for me is to make something that looks beautiful and proceedurally reacts to the music or sound that is inputted, I hope that the different frequencies react differently to the real time sound. a majority of the functionality will be done in the code in visual studio. the game objects will be created in unnity itself and implemented then after.

I hope to use Mathematical principals to decide where the different game objects are and where they go and how they react to the sound from the sound source. I also think it would be a good idea and nice twist on the project that, i can implement using a midi keybourd used for making music. you can choose a sound and use the keyboard to produce the different visual effects on the screen and display a beautiful graphical experience for the user of the application.

With these two aspects, I feel I can create some great experience for the user of the application. The implementation of the midi keyboard may be difficult but i feel if i cann get it done it will be a great controller. I got this idea from Brian Duggan controlling his visual effects mid DJ-set on a dance floor..Although the audio may not be useful for the dancefloor itself i feel the keyboard could be a great tool for future projects like this for Brian.
